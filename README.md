Make sure the litellm server is running, and then run the following command to setup the BeeAI platform environment:
```bash
beeai env setup
```

```txt
? Select LLM provider: Other               🔧 provide API URL
? Enter the base URL of your API (OpenAI-compatible): http://localhost:4000
? Enter API key: dummy
? Select a model (type to filter): meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct

You're all set! (You can re-run this setup anytime with beeai env setup)
```

🎉 Awesome! Now you can use the BeeAI platform with watsonx.ai!
